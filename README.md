# quadro_c
Project of miniquadrocopter

An original idea belongs to tobbeanton from Bitcraze AB.

An idea was to make my own controller for quadrocopter.
You can find here schematics (original files for P-CAD with library are included).
Also there are firmware and source code in repo.

The device based on Atmel microcontroller MEGA328, have two sensors: digital accelerometer LIS331DL and digital gyroscope L3G4200D.
The flying now is unstable and I'm working on it.
